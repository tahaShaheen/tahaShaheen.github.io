I helped organize the Voices of Partition event in Sindh Rural Support Organization in Sukkur (SRSO), Sindh. Witnesses spoke of their experiences. I was Master of Ceremonies and briefly spoke
of my experience as an interviewer and collector of stories. News story about this event can be found <a href="https://timesofislamabad.com/28-Apr-2017/india-pakistan-partition-stories-shared-by-those-who-witnessed-it">here</a>.
