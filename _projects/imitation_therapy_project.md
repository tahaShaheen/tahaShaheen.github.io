I collaborated with a team of four undergraduate students and therapists from <a href="https://www.duhs.edu.pk/new/ipmr-introduction/" target="_blank">Dow Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation</a> to augment a <a href=“https://wowwee.com/robosapien-x” target=”_blank"> Robosapien by WowWee robotics</a>. We used <a href=“https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose” target=“_blank”> OpenPose </a> and an <a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU”>ESP8266 nodemcu</a> to enable the robot to (1) mimic a single person’s arm movements and (2) recognize when a person had successfully imitated the robot’s arm position.
