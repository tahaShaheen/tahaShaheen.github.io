I wrote an Android app in Java, programmed and installed an <a href="https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html">ESP8266 nodemcu</a> in an air conditioner, and set up a backend on <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Google Firebase</a>. I configured the AC to turn on at a certain time of the day. I also wrote an app to remotely operate the AC through WiFi.
